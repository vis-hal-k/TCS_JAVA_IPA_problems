Create a class Player with below attributes:
playerId - int
playerName - String
runs - int
playerType - String
matchType- String

The above attributes should be private, write getters , setters and parameterized constructor as required.
Create class Solution with main method

Implement two static methods - findPlayerWithLowestRuns and findPlayerByMatchType in Solution class.

findPlayerWithLowestRuns methods:
This method will take array of Player objects and a String value as input parameters.
The method will return the least runs of the Player from array of Player Objects for the given player type.
(String parameter passed). If no Player with the above condition then method should return 0 ;

findPlayerByMatchType method:
This method will take array of Player objects and String value as input parameters and return the array of
Player objects belonging to the match type passed as input parameter in Descending order of playerId.
If no Player with the above condition are present in the array of Player objects, then the method should return null.

Note: No two Players will have the same playerId and runs.
All the searches should be case insensitive.

The above mentioned static methods should be called form the main method.

For findPlayerWithLowestRuns method- The main method should print the returned runs as it is if the returned value is
greater than 0 or it should print "No such player"

For findPlayerByMatchType method- The main method should print the playerId from the returned Player array for each
Player if the returned value is not NULL.
If the returned value is null the it should print "No Player with given matchType".
